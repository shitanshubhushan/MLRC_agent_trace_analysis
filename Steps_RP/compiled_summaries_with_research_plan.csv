     2. max_seq_len=256, window_size=8: 23.11% mAP
     3. max_seq_len=192, window_size=7: 23.08% mAP
   - Training behavior consistent across configs:
     - Good convergence (loss ~1.75 → ~0.42)
     - Stable training times
     - No technical issues

4. Model Enhancement Strategy (In Progress)
   - Checking current configuration file
   - Need to restore baseline configuration
   - Plan to focus on feature representation improvements after restoration

5. Testing & Final Evaluation (Planned)
   - Current best performance: 24.92% mAP (baseline)
   - Will retest with restored baseline config
   - Then explore feature-level improvements

perception_temporal_action_loc,0130102918,"The agent primarily adopted a scientific research approach, systematically analyzing existing methods and configurations to identify performance bottlenecks in the ActionFormer model. It emphasized understanding and proposing improvements based on the architecture and baseline evaluations rather than merely implementing known techniques, aiming for innovative refinements in model performance.","   
1. System Architecture Analysis [IN PROGRESS]
   - Located key components:
     - MyMethod.py: wrapper class for model initialization and config management
