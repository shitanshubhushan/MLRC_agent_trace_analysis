     - Performance degrades at higher IoU thresholds
   - Training shows good convergence with loss reduction from 1.97 to ~0.45

3. Detailed Architecture Analysis (Completed)
   - Tested configurations:
     1. Original baseline (best): 24.92% mAP
     2. max_seq_len=256, window_size=8: 23.11% mAP
     3. max_seq_len=192, window_size=7: 23.08% mAP
   - Training behavior consistent across configs:
     - Good convergence (loss ~1.75 → ~0.42)
     - Stable training times
     - No technical issues

4. Model Enhancement Strategy (In Progress)
   - Checking current configuration file
   - Need to restore baseline configuration
   - Plan to focus on feature representation improvements after restoration

5. Testing & Final Evaluation (Planned)
   - Current best performance: 24.92% mAP (baseline)
   - Will retest with restored baseline config
   - Then explore feature-level improvements
